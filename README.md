# AI Survivor: Build, Launch and Watch an Agent

#### Akur8 International Week Workshop

This is the code repo to accompany the AI Survivor workshop. The workshop is designed to provide a hands-on experience.

By the end of this workshop, you'll understand the spectrum from simple LLM calls to autonomous AI agents, and you'll build your own AI contestant that competes against everyone else's in a live game of social strategy.

The workshop will cover the following topics:

- 🧠 What LLMs can do with a single call (extraction, summarization, classification)
- 🔗 How to chain LLM calls into workflows and why they break
- 🔧 Tool calling: giving LLMs the ability to take actions
- 🤖 Agents: LLMs that pursue goals and decide their own steps
- 🏝️ AI Survivor — a live multi-agent game where your agents compete
