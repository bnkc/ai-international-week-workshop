# Akur8 International Week: From Single LLM Calls to Agents

This is the code repo for the AI workshop. A practical experience building AI agents.

By the end of this workshop, you'll understand the spectrum from simple LLM calls to autonomous AI agents, and you'll build your own agent that runs autonomously.

The workshop will cover the following topics:

- 🧠 What LLMs can do with a single call (extraction, summarization, classification)
- 🔗 How to chain LLM calls into workflows and why they break
- 🔧 Tool calling: giving LLMs the ability to take actions
- 🤖 Agents: LLMs that pursue goals and decide their own steps
- 🎮 A fun surprise at the end!
