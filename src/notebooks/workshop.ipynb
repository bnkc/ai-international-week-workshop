Just run each cell in order and follow along.\n\n### What We're Building Toward\n\nBy the end of this workshop, you'll have built an AI \"contestant\" with its own personality and strategy. All our agents will then be dropped into a shared game where they:\n\n1. **Talk**\n2. **Form alliances**\n3. **Vote**"
